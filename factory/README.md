# The Factory Pattern

The factory design pattern is a creational design pattern used to create concrete implementations of a common interface. The goal is to seperate the process of creating an object from the code that depends on the interface of the object.

I'm going to try and implement a Python version of the Pizza Store example laid out in O'Reilly's *Head First Design Patterns* [chapter on the Factory Pattern](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/ch04.html).
